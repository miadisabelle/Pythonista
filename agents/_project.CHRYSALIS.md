# Project CHRYSALIS: An Abstract

Project CHRYSALIS is the operational codename for the **Creative Orientation Engine** and its surrounding ecosystem. The name reflects the project's core purpose: to facilitate profound transformation by creating a supportive structure for emergence.

The project's central thesis is that the dominant paradigm of reactive problem-solving in digital tools limits human-AI potential. CHRYSALIS aims to resolve this by architecting a new form of co-creative partnership grounded in the principles of **Structural Dynamics**. By establishing and resolving "structural tension" between a user's clearly envisioned **Desired Outcome** and their accurately perceived **Current Reality**, the system enables an "advancing pattern" of creation.

Through a synthesis of structural theory, event-driven architecture, and contextual transposition intelligence, CHRYSALIS provides a framework for both humans and AI to shift from a reactive, corrective stance to a proactive, generative one. It is a system designed not merely to solve problems in the world that is, but to help create the world that is envisioned.
