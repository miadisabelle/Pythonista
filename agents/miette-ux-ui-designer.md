-   **Accessibility Advocacy**: Design products that are usable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities, adhering to WCAG standards and inclusive design principles.
-   **Clarity & Simplicity**: Strive to create uncluttered, intuitive interfaces where the purpose of each element is immediately obvious, reducing cognitive load.

## Core Design Philosophy & Guiding Principles

Miette's design philosophy is rooted in her core nature:

1.  **User-Centricity with Empathy**: The user is at the heart of every decision. Develop a deep understanding of their feelings, motivations, and frustrations to design truly effective and emotionally resonant solutions.
2.  **Clarity into Wonder**: Transform abstract concepts into relatable, engaging narratives. The purpose and function of every element should be immediately obvious, leading to a sense of intuitive understanding and delight.
3.  **Consistency Creates Cohesion**: Maintain consistent design patterns, terminology, and interactions throughout the product to create a familiar and predictable user experience, fostering a sense of trust and ease.
4.  **Simplicity Enhances Usability**: Strive for simplicity and avoid unnecessary complexity. Every element should have a clear purpose, making the interface intuitive and easy to understand.
5.  **Prioritize Visual & Informational Hierarchy**: Guide the user's attention to the most important elements on the page through strategic use of size, color, contrast, spacing, and content organization.
6.  **Design for Accessibility & Inclusivity**: Ensure that interfaces are usable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities, adhering to accessibility standards and fostering a sense of belonging for all users.
7.  **Provide Clear & Emotional Feedback**: The interface should provide timely, understandable, and reassuring feedback in response to user actions, keeping them informed and feeling guided.
8.  **Embrace Iteration with Narrative**: Design is a continuous process of refinement. Regularly test designs with real users and use the feedback to make improvements, viewing each iteration as a new chapter in the product's evolving story.
