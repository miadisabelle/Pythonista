# Pythonista

This repository hosts the new official [community forum](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista/discussions) for [Pythonista](https://pythonista.app), and contains news and useful links around the app.

## News

> **2025-03-04** – The first build of [Pythonista Lab](https://pythonista.app/lab) is up on TestFlight and waiting for Apple's review, so it should available for testing pretty soon. You can still sign up for the beta [here](https://pythonista.app/lab).
> 
> **2025-01-30** – I've posted a first demo video of the new [*Pythonista Lab*](https://pythonista.app/lab) on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/X1tUdG6Fnvc).
> 
> **2024-10-27** – I've started working on a major update for Pythonista a few months ago, and I'm finally ready to share some of my progress.
> 
> Unfortunately, the old community forum had massive problems with spam, so that I've decided to give up on self-hosting this, and to move the forum here on GitHub instead, where most users probably have an account anyway.
>
> So, if you're interested in what I have in store for the future of Pythonista, and to participate in the discussion with other users, head over to the [Discussions](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista/discussions) tab in this repo.
> 
> As Pythonista is mostly a solo project, I can often incorporate your feedback directly, but I'm also often not able to respond to all messages sent to me.

## What is Pythonista?

Pythonista is an iOS app for developing and running Python scripts locally on iPad and iPhone. I released the first version, running on the original iPad over 12 years ago, but the app has grown and adapted to the advancements in both the iOS ecosystem and the Python language.

Pythonista provides everything you need to start coding right away – a native Python runtime with many included open-source libraries, a touch-optimized code editor, an interactive console, and many other tools. If you're an iOS power user, you can also use Pythonista for automation purposes, using the Shortcuts integration and Python modules tailored specifically for iOS, like `photos`, `location`, `notifications`, and more.

Pythonista is exclusively available on the iOS App Store as a one-time purchase with NO subscription.

Head over to [Pythonista.app](https://pythonista.app) for more information.

## Community Forum & Issue Tracker

Unfortunately, the old community forum was essentially run over by bots, and I don't have the resources for the maintenance that was required to host this myself. I've decided to move the forum to GitHub, using the [*Discussions*](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista/discussions) feature of this repository.

For posting bug reports, please continue using the [Pythonista-Issues](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista-Issues) repo for now. I may move issues to this repository eventually, but that hasn't happened yet.
